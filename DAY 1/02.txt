//History of JavaScript

In 1995 - Created by Brendan Each at NetScape in just 10 days.

Mocha --> LiveScript --> JavaScript

Switching from LiveScript to javaScript was a smart move to make it sound cooler and piggyback on Java's fame, while also cozing up to Sun Microsystems.


1996 --> JS was created  

1997 --> It was then submitted to ECMA international for standardization, which resulted in ECMAScript    

2015 --> ES6 / ECMAScript 2015 - Decided to switch to annual releases of ECMAScript.
